# NITH - Recruiter

This repository is for the final year term project where we aim to create a **Recruitment Helper** for the students of NITH. Our project aims to develop a easy to use web platform that will keep all faculty and students notified of all the placement activity and the important dates for tests and interviews.

## Motivation

During the placement season, it becomes very hectic for students to manage important test and interview dates from whatsapp notices. Hence, to reduce time spent searching for important dates in whatsapp chats, we created a web platform that will provide important test and interview dates in a concise and orderly manner.
